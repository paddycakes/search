Search Application
-------------------

## Overview

A tool to traverse a directory hierarchy, from a specified root directory, and print a list of all files which match the file name specified with the -f option.

	ï¿¼search -f "pom.xml" <directory>

## Gradle Build

The project is built with Gradle:

http://www.gradle.org/

This project includes the Gradle Wrapper (gradlew):

http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html

The Gradle Wrapper is a batch script on Windows or a shell script on *nix. When you start a Gradle build via the wrapper, Gradle will be automatically downloaded and used to run the build. This provides the benefit that anyone can work with it without needing to install Gradle beforehand. It also ensures that users are guaranteed to use the version of Gradle that the build was designed to work with.
